# DES Cipher

## What's this all about?
The Data Encryption Standard was once the most widely used encryption algorithm in the world, but is now considered insecure because of its short key length of 56 bits. I demonstrated how we can implement and break DES encryption using different techniques.

This repo includes:
* **DES.py**: Python code showing how to crack DES using multiple attack methods
* **des.html**: An interactive web tool for visualizing DES operations and breaking techniques

## The breaking methods
This project demonstrates 3 main techniques for breaking DES ciphers:

1. **Brute Force Attack**
2. **Weak Key Detection**
3. **Known-Plaintext Attack**
