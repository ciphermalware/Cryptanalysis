# XOR Cipher

## What's this all about?
This project demonstrates how we can implement and break XOR encryption.

This repo includes:
* **xor_cipher.py**: Python code showing how to encrypt, decrypt, and crack XOR ciphers
* **xor_cipher.html**: An interactive web tool for visualizing XOR operations and breaking techniques


## The breaking methods
This project demonstrates 3 main techniques for breaking XOR ciphers:

1. **Key Length Determination**: Using Hamming distance analysis to find the most likely key length
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Analyzing byte frequencies in each position to determine individual key bytes
3. **Entropy Analysis**: Measuring information to evaluate the randomness and patterns in encrypted data
