This project demonstrates 3 main techniques for breaking RC4 ciphers

1. Fluhrer-McGrew-Mantin Attack: Exploiting weaknesses in RC4's key scheduling algorithm, when used with specific initialization vectors
2. WEP Attack: Breaking the WEP protocol implementation of RC4 through IV collection and statistical analysis
3. Keystream Bias Analysis: Statistical biases in the RC4 keystream to recover encrypted data
