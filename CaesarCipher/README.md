# Caesar Cipher

A simple implementation of the Caesar cipher encryption algorithm, with both Python and interactive HTML versions.

## Project Contents

This repository contains three main components:

1. **Caesar.py** - Core Python implementation of the Caesar cipher algorithm
2. **caesar_cipher.html** - Interactive web based implementation for visualizing the cipher
3. **output.png** - Screenshot showing the interactive interface in action

## Python Implementation

`Caesar.py` provides a command-line implementation of the Caesar cipher with the following features:
- Text encryption with custom shift values
- Decryption with known keys
- Brute-force decryption to demonstrate the cipher's vulnerability
